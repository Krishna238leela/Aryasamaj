          <p>Arya Samaj Sunday 5.00pm to 7:00 pm to serve this need of the community and propagate the message and principles of Vedic Dharma. Timing of Sunday Satsang is coordinated in such a way that while children attend DAV Sanskriti School, their parents get the opportunity to participate in Satsang.</p>

          <p>Satsang begins with the Meditation, a very powerful means to ameliorate the restless wandering mind and enjoy the presence in one's heart and life. Meditation is an essential step in the spiritual journey. It brings silence and solace, an inexpressible experience of peace to reach God.</p>

          <p>Havan is performed completely in Vedic way with special Vedic Verses according to the occasion. Havan is also a weekly reminder to the present congregation that we must undertake all actions with a sense of sacrifice, love and devotion. Our deeds are our destiny.</p>

          <p>Bhajans (devotional songs) are an important part of our Satsang. These Bhajans are led by a professional teacher and talented singers among the members and sung in unison by the congregation. Bhajans remind us that while many paths lead to attain the bliss of God there may be none so enjoyable as singing His praise.</p>

          <p>In our weekly Satsang children of D.A.V Sanskriti School are encouraged to speak on different topics related to social, cultural and Dharmic issues. This way, children not only learn to get rid of the fear of public speaking but also they have an opportunity to show what they are learning in the Sanskriti School.</p>
